Simple to use Table Save and Table Load functions for Lua and Corona SDK

USAGE:

local loadsave = require("loadsave)

myTable = {}
myTable.musicOn = false
myTable.soundOn = true

loadsave.saveTable(myTable, "myTable.json")

Then to read it back in:

myTable = loadssave.loadTable("myTable.json")

This basic code, uses system.DocumentsDirectory to save game settings.  If you need to save
files to other locations, you will need to modify the code to use a different directory like
system.CachesDirectory or system.TemporaryDirectory
